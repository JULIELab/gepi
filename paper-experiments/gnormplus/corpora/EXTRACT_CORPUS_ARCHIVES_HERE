Extract here the original archives for the BioCreative2,
BioCreative3 and NLM-Gene corpora.
The JULIE Lab GNormPlus processing pipelines link to this location.

Of note, for BioCreative3 evaluation  the evaluation files are downloaded
separately from BioCreative in the GNTestEval.zip archive.

Note for NLM-Gene corpus: The official download from 2021
consists of documents in BioC format. That format is not
used here because the 2021 BioC release seems to miss
a significant amount of annotations in comparison
to the non-public version in PubTator format. The
PubTator version was used for the evaluations in the
NLM-Gene paper and also for the GePI paper. The PubTator
version was obtained by contacting the authors when
internal evaluations of GNormPlus did not reproduce
the results from the NLM-Gene paper.
Thus, be careful to either obtain an updated version
of the official corpus - which did not exist as of
November 2022 - or request the PubTator format corpus
from the GNormPlus developers.
