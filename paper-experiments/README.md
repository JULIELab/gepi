# GePI NLP Pipeline Experiments
This directory contains code and scripts for the evaluation of the main parts of the GePI NLP pipeline, GNormPlus and BioSem. 
**This code and pipelines are not used anywhere else in GePI but are here for evaluation purposes only.**
There are experiments to show the evaluation scores of the GNormPlus version used in GePI and experiments to show the impact of the gene recognition step on event extraction with BioSem.

The respective numbers didn't make it into the NAR publication due to space constraints. Also this would rather make a new paper discussing the impact of combining components into a pipeline that have only been evaluated separately before (here GNormPlus for the recognition of genes/proteins and BioSem that finds interactions between mentions of those entities in the literature).

Please refer to the README.md files in the respective sub directories for information on the experiments contained in the respective directories.
