                        All the required components and code are freely available, see <a href="#gepi-open-source" class="link-secondary">below</a>.
                        However, PubMed and PubMed central
                        (open access subset) are large text repositories and require significant
                        computational resources for reasonable processing times. As a rule of thumb, 50-60 CPU cores
                        and machines with at least 64GB of memory are recommended. Depending on the quality of the hardware,
                        lower numbers might still be adequate. The GePI pipeline has actually rather modest
                        requirements on hardware. No GPUs are needed.

                        How exactly are gene names mapped to gene IDs in a GePI query?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        We match the input names after a normalization step to the NCBI Gene symbols in our database.
                        The normalization step includes lower-casing of the name and the removal of punctuation and white spaces so that, for example, <code>il2</code> and <code>il-2</code> are both mapped to <code>IL2</code>.
                        Gene name matching will often find multiple matches in our database despite the fact that we use the NCBI <a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2018/02/27/gene_orthologs-file-gene-ftp/" target="_blank" class="link-secondary">gene_orthologs</a> file to create single representatives for orthologous genes. Sometimes not all species are (yet) included in the file. Since the genes that exist in several species often carry the same name, this could result in multiple input matches. It is also possible that the normalization causes multiple symbols to match.
                        For this reason, the symbol mapping table in the statistics element of the result dashboard shows the most frequent target name for an input gene name. Still, all found elements will be searched for in GePI. If this leads to unwanted results, it is recommended to use <t:pagelink page="Help" anchor="input-specification" target="_blank" class="link-secondary">canonical gene IDs</t:pagelink> in the query.

                        Why do I receive interactions with genes that are not in my search query?
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        Queries for families, complexes and gene groups also match their parts or members. For example, a query for <code>AKT</code> will retrieve interactions including <code>AKT1</code>. This is most obvious when searching for GO terms where the query result consists of genes annotated with the GO term contained in the query - even if the query does not contain a single gene name or ID.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Why do full-text query or filter results highlight words that do not seem to match a query term?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        For full-text queries GePI expands abbreviations. Consider the abbreviation <em>cyclic mechanical stress (CMS)</em>, used for example in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654047/" class="link-secondary" target="_blank">PMC2654047</a>. It is introduced at the beginning of the document and then used throughout the text. Thus, the query <em>stress</em> would only work on the first occurrence of the term when the long form is given. To allow matches for all the other places, too, we internally expand abbreviations to make such matches possible.
