                        Which NLP tools are used in GePI to find molecular interactions in the literature?

                        Can I do the NLP processing on my own?

                        All the required components and code is freely available. However, PubMed and PubMed central
                        (open access subset) are large text repositories and their processing required significant
                        computational resources for reasonable processing times. As a rule of thumb, 50-60 CPU cores
                        and machines with at least 64GB of memory are recommended. Depending on the quality of the hardware,
                        lower resources might still be adequate. The  GePI pipeline has actually rather modest
                        requirements on hardware, for example, no GPUs are needed.
