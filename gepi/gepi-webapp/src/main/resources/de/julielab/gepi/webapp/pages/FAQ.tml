                        Which NLP tools are used in GePI to find molecular interactions in the literature?

                        Can I do the NLP processing on my own?

                        All the required components and code is freely available. However, PubMed and PubMed central
                        (open access subset) are large text repositories and their processing required significant
                        computational resources for reasonable processing times. As a rule of thumb, 50-60 CPU cores
                        and machines with at least 64GB of memory are recommended. Depending on the quality of the hardware,
                        lower resources might still be adequate. The  GePI pipeline has actually rather modest
                        requirements on hardware, for example, no GPUs are needed.

                        How exactly are gene names mapped to gene IDs?

                        Why do I receive interactions with genes I did not query for

                    <dd>
                        queries for families, complexes and gene groups return their parts or members, just like GO terms

                    <dt>Why do full-text query or filter results highlight words that do not seem to match a query term?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        For full-text queries GePI expands abbreviation. Consider the abbreviation <span class="em">cyclic mechanical stress (CMS)</span>, used for example in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2654047/" class="link-secondary" target="_blank">PMC2654047</a>. It is introduced at the beginning of the document and then used throughout the text. Thus, when the query <em>stress</em> would only work on the first occurrence of the term when the long form is given. To allow matches for all the other places, too, we internally expand abbreviations to make such matches possible.  <t:pagelink page="Index" anchor="tableresult_widget" parameters="literal:{alist:bmp1,bmp2,smad1,sentencefilter=stress}" target="_blank" title="Click to start an example search filtered by the word 'stress' that will be found in abbreviations." data-bs-toggle="default-tooltip">
