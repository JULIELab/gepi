                        <p>
                            This Web page offers the retrieval and display bio-molecular interactions that have been
                            extracted from the scientific literature via text mining.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The focus lies on interactions that involve genes, gene products, families, complexes and
                            groups of genes. For the purpose of this service, no difference is made between genes and
                            their products. Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP) algorithms are employed to scan the text of documents from
                            PubMed and the PubMed Central open access subset for mentions of interactions between these
                            types of
                            entities. Recognized interactions contain gene expression, phosphorylation, positive and
                            negative regulation and physical binding events. For example, the sentence

                            For this service, the gene/protein names are recognized and molecular events are extracted from the document text.
                            Interactions that include multiple events are simplified to a single GePI database item that records the
                            entities and the interaction/event types: <span class="entity">Fibroblast growth factor-1</span> and <span

                            </span>, <span class="trigger">(up-)regulation</span> and <span class="trigger">gene expression</span>. This is an example of a binary interaction between two entities. Events can refer to a single entity and, thus, be unary. Frequent examples are phosphorylation events when the cause of the activation is either not mentioned or is not an entity in the scope of GePI. Consider the example

                            Both, binary and unary events are included in the GePI search index. In result displays that require two interaction partners, unary events are either filtered out - e.g. for Sankey charts - or do not show second interaction partner information - e.g. the result table.

                            At the heart of a GePI search lies the specification of one or two lists of genes, proteins or families, complexes and groups of them. Recognized names or IDs include
                            <ul>
                                <li><a class="link-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/">NCBI Gene</a> IDs and symbols</li>

                            The first list of identifiers will be called <em>List A</em> or <em>A-List</em> and the second one will be called <em>List B</em> or <em>B-List</em> all over the Web page.

                            Given a gene name or database ID, GePI makes best efforts to recognize the search term and resolve it to one of the above databases. In some cases, IDs are ambiguous across multiple databases. For example, NCBI Gene as well as HGNC Groups use numbers as IDs. If an input ID is not recognized as expected, database prefixes can be used for disambiguation, e.g. <code>gene:2475</code> refers to the human mTOR NCBI Gene entry.
                            Prefixes are separated via a colon <code>:</code> from the specific database ID. This even possible if the ID already includes a prefix of its own like HGNC or GO. The following database prefixes are used:
                            <table class="table">
                                <tr>

                            It is possible to omit the specification of List A and List B completely if at least one of the three full-text filter fields is specified. The result will contain the interactions that appeared in the sentences or paragraphs that match the respective full-text query. Basic boolean operators are possible, for example <code>+</code> is used for <code>AND</code>, the pipe symbol <code>|</code> signifies a boolean <code>OR</code> and quotes <code>"..."</code> denote an phrase expression that groups words togther, e.g. <code><t:pagelink page="Index" parameters="literal:{sentencefilter:%22MAPK%20pathway%22%20|%20%22MAPK%20signaling%22}" target="_blank">"MAPK pathway" | "MAPK signaling"</t:pagelink></code> searches for <code>MAPK pathway OR MAPK signaling</code> where the text is required to contain the exact phrases. The query syntax is specified in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/query-dsl-simple-query-string-query.html" class="link-secondary" target="_blank">ElasticSearch Simple Query String Query</a> with all operators enabled.
                            When both sentence and paragraph filters are specified, the way to combine both filters can be selected using the button between the input fields. "AND" means that an interaction must match both filters to be included in the result, "OR" includes all interactions that match either filter.

                            The section heading search aims at interactions mentioned within sections whose headings match the specified query. All interactions in the database store the names of the sections or subsections they are contained in. As an example, consider the following section structure.

                            The selection of a factuality item filters interactions to be assigned the selected or a higher - more assertive - factuality level. Thus, selecting <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">moderate</span> will allow interactions
                            with <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">moderate</span>, <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">high</span> and <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">assertion</span> factuality levels to be included in the result. Thus, the default
                            selection lies on <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">negation</span> which does not impose any factuality restriction.

                        <p>
                            Upon successful submission of query, die input panel disappears to left of the screen. A handle
                            bar remains that can be clicked on to slide it back into view.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subsequently, the result dashboard is displayed. It offers basic statistics about the search
                            query itself and the resulting interactions, a number of data visualizations and a table that
                            contains the individual interactions with their textual reference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gene and protein interaction partners are grouped into orthologous clusters
                            as far as the underlying resources contain such cluster information. Additionally,
                            items with the same NCBI Gene symbol are collapsed into a single group since they would
                            obtain the same label anyway. Thus, gene names appear only once in charts and aggregated
                            statistics instead of once for each species in the result data.
                            In case of invalid name mergings, multiple separate GePI queries
                            are recommended that specify only one of the separate but equal-named genes, respectively.
                        </p>
                        <p id="interaction-partner-order">
                            Almost all information on the dashboard refers to A-List or B-List interaction partners,
                            even if one or both of the lists may actually be empty. In case of a pure full-text search
                            where List A and List B are empty, the
                            A- and B order refers to the textual order that the interaction have in a specific place
                            in the searched literature. If List A or both lists are specified, all interactions are
                            re-ordered such that the
                            interaction partner that is part of the A-List appears first before calculating the
                            statistics and visualizations. In open search scenarios - when only List A is non-empty - the
                            B-List items
                            represent the 'other' retrieved interaction partners that were not part of the query.

                        <p>
                            In the following, the different dashboard elements are explained.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="statistics">Statistics Element</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Statistics dashboard element offers insight into the number of results, the most
                            frequent interaction partners and how the input query elements were recognized by the
                            Web application. The search input tables are shown for the non-empty input lists. Thus,
                            zero, one or two tables may be displayed for a given query.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The search input tables offer insight into the database entry an input was mapped to
                            and reports inputs that could not be recognized at all. In case of unrecognized items,
                            refer to <a href="#input-specification" class="link-secondary">Input Specification</a> for information
                            about accepted names and IDs.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="pie-chart">Pie Chart</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Pie Chart dashboard element offers a quick overview of the most frequent interaction
                            partners. There are two tabs that allow to switch between the display of
                            <a href="#interaction-partner-order" class="link-secondary">A or B interaction partners</a> and an input field
                            for the specification of the top N most frequent interaction partners to show. There is
                            always an additional Pie slice that carries the 'others' label. That slice accumulates
                            the frequency of all the interaction partners beyond the top N. In this way, the Pie Chart
                            slice proportions correspond to the actual proportion in the data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For open searches or large input lists, the Pie Chart may become consumed by the 'others'
                            slice. In this case, a look on the <a href="#bar-chart" class="link-secondary">Bar Chart</a>
                            is recommended. Since a Bar Chart does not necessarily display a part-whole relationship,
                            the 'others' bar may be switched off there to leave room for the top N interaction partners.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that that smallest Pie Slices may not receive a callout with the name of the respective
                            interaction partner due to spacial collision reasons.
                            Hover the mouse cursor over such slices to see a tooltip that will
                            provide the name.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="bar-chart">Bar Chart</h3>
                        <p>
                            Similar to the <a href="#pie-chart" class="link-secondary">Pie Chart</a>, the Bar Chart
                            displays the most frequent interaction partners, either from
                            <a href="#interaction-partner-order" class="link-secondary">List A or List B.</a>
                            It also allows to switch between lists and the specification of the number of interaction
                            partners to display in one chart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Bar Chart allows to display or hide the special 'others' bar through the drop-down menu next
                            to it. This bar accumulates the frequencies of all the interaction partners that are not
                            contained in the top N most frequent interactions partners that are currently shown. For
                            open searches or large closed searches, this bar may dominate the whole plot in which case
                            it is recommended to hide it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The bars show tooltips upon hovering the mouse cursor over them, showing the gene name
                        and frequency.</p>
                        <h3 id="sankey-charts">Sankey Charts</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Sankey Charts show interaction instead of interaction partner distributions. All
                            interactions with the same arguments in the same
                            <a href="interaction-partner-order" class="link-secondary">A-B order</a>
                            are accumulated to obtain the frequency of an interaction
                            in the result set. Sankey Charts leverage the frequency information to vary the thickness
                            of an edge between two gene symbol nodes as well as the size of the node. The more frequent
                            an interaction appears in the result, the thicker its edge is shown. Gene symbols that
                            participate very frequently in interactions are correspondingly larger. For each gene, the
                            Sankey Charts show the proportion of its interaction to other genes in the result set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a Sankey Chart is enlarged using the respective button in its header,
                            additional control items will be shown to change the space between the nodes and
                            whether or not to display the 'other' nodes. These nodes represent the accumulated
                            frequencies of the interaction partners that are not explicitly shown in the chart.
                            For open searches or large closed searches, these nodes can get overly large.
                            It is recommended to deactivate the nodes in such cases but to keep in mind that
                            this truncates interactions from the Chart and skews the proportional aspect
                            of the visualization.

                        <p>
                            The Most frequent Interactions Sankey Chart aggregates all result interactions as described
                            above and displays the most frequent ones.

                        <p>
                            The Common Interaction Partners Sankey Chart also aggregates over all result interactions
                            like the Most frequent Interactions Sankey Chart but orders the interactions differently
                            to determine the top N items for display. The aim is to elevate those genes that
                            connect two other genes through interactions in high frequency. The resulting view
                            features indirect connections between two genes through such a third gene they both
                            are often described to interact with in the literature.

                            The table displays the interactions as they were extracted from the Literature
                            providing the source document ID and the specific text portion that contains
                            the interaction description. The table can be browsed using the paging buttons at the bottom.

                            their <a href="#filter-factuality" class="link-secondary">factuality rating</a> and the sentence from the

                        <p>
                            GePI offers a Web-API that allows programmatic access. All elements of the input form can be
                            expressed through the API. As a result, the excel sheet
                            (see <a href="#result-download" class="link-secondary">above</a>) or a tab-separated file
                            flatly listing all retrieved interactions can be obtained.

                        <p>
                            The API is realized through URL request parameters, i.e. the GePI Web address followed by a
                            single question mark (<code>?</code>) and parameter-value pairs. A parameter-value pair
                            is separated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>) and a sequence of such pairs are separated by
