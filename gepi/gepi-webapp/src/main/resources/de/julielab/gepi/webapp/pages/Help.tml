                        <p>
                            This Web page offers the retrieval and display bio-molecular interactions that have been
                            extracted from the scientific literature via text mining.

                        <p>
                            The focus lies on interactions that involve genes, gene products, families, complexes and
                            groups of genes. For the purpose of this service, no difference is made between genes and
                            their products. Text mining algorithms are employed to search the text of documents from
                            PubMed and the PubMed Central open access subset for mentions of interactions between these
                            types of
                            entities. Recognized interactions contain gene expression, phosphorylation, positive and
                            negative regulation and physical binding events. For example, the sentence

                            For this service, the gene/protein names are recognized and regulation events are extracted.
                            Focus on the gene/protein entities is given. Thus, although there are multiple regulations
                            mentioned, the interaction is simplified to a single GePI database item that records the
                            entities and the interaction/event types: <span class="entity">gp41</span> and <span
                                    class="entity">IL-10

Events can refer to a single entity and, thus, be unary. Frequent examples are phosphorylation events when the cause of the activation is either not mentioned or is not an entity in the scope of GePI. Consider the example

                            Both, binary and unary events are included in the GePI search index. In result displays that require two interaction partners, unary events are either filtered out - e.g. for Sankey charts - or do not show second interaction partner information - e.g. the result table.

                            At the heart of a GePI search lies the specification of one or two lists of genes, proteins or families, complexes and groups of them. Recognized names or IDs include
                            <ul>

                            The first list of identifiers will be called <em>List A</em> or <em>A-List</em> and the second one will be called <em>List B</em> or <em>B-List</em> all over the Web page.

                            Given a gene name or database ID, GePI makes best efforts to recognize the search term and resolve it to one of the above databases. In some cases, IDs are ambiguous across multiple databases. For example, NCBI Gene as well as HGNC Groups use numbers as IDs. If an input ID is not recognized as expected, database prefixes can be used for disambiguation, e.g. <code>gene:2475</code> refers to the human mTOR NCBI Gene entry.
                            Prefixes are separated via a colon <code>:</code> from the specific database ID. This even possible if the ID already includes a prefix of its own like HGNC or GO. The following database prefixes are used:
                            <table class="table">
                                <tr>

                            <em>Open search.</em> When List A is specified but List B is not, this is called an open search because the set of possible interaction partners is left open. The result will contain interactions that have an item of List A as one interaction partner and any other interaction partner. No events will be returned where both interaction partners belong to List A. If this should be allowed, a closed search can be performed where List A and List B are set to the same list of identifiers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <em>Closed search.</em> When List A and List B are provided, this is called a closed search because a closed set of interaction partners has been defined. Result interactions will always contain one interaction partner from List A and one from List B. Entries are allowed to exist in both lists. No events will be returned that contain the same gene as both interaction partners.

                            <em>Full-text search.</em> It is possible to omit specification of List A and List B completely if at least one of the three full-text filter fields is given input to. The result will contain the interactions that appeared in the sentences or paragraphs that match the respective full-text query. The section heading search works a bit different. All interactions in the database store the names of the sections or subsections they are contained in. As an example, consider the following section structure.

                            <em>Result filters.</em> A GePI search can be filtered for species via NCBI Taxonomy identifiers, interaction types, and factuality level.
                            These filters cannot constitute searches of their own but exist to solely to restrict the search defined by the methods described above.

                        <p>
                            <em>Taxonomy filter.</em>A comma-separated list of NCBI Taxonomy IDs may be provided to filter on the interaction partners.
                            NCBI Gene entries are always assigned a exactly one taxonomy ID. The GePI text processing pipeline also assigns species to protein families
                            based on the species discussed in the respective document. The species are stored as taxonomy IDs in the interaction database and
                            also used for species filter purposes. In case no species is mentioned at all - which commonly happens in PubMed abstracts - the human
                            taxonomy ID 9606 is assigned as this the most frequent organism discussed in PubMed.

                        <p>
                            <em>Interaction types filter.</em> By default, interactions of all types are included into a search result. This selection can be reduced to focus on specific interaction types, e.g. phosphorylation events regarding the input gene lists.

                            <em>Inclusion of single gene events.</em> The interaction extraction algorithm frequently finds molecular event descriptions that refer to a single gene without further interaction partners as described in <a href="#purpose-of-this-website">Purpose of this Web site</a>.</p>
                            These unary events are excluded from the search results by default. They will be included if the button is activated.

                            The selection of a factuality item filters interactions to be assigned the selected or a higher - more assertive - factuality level. Thus, selecting <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">moderate</span> will allow interactions

                            selection lies on <span class="badge text-bg-secondary">negation</span> which does not impose any factuality restriction.

                        <p>
                            Subsequently, the result dashboard is displayed. It offers basic statistics about the search
                            query itself and the resulting interactions, a number of data visualizations and a table that
                            contains the individual interactions with their textual reference.

                            The gene and protein interaction partners are grouped into orthologous clusters
                            as far as the underlying resources contain such cluster information. Additionally,
                            items with the same NCBI Gene symbol are collapsed into a single group since they would
                            obtain the same label anyway. Thus, gene names appear only once in charts and aggregated
                            statistics instead of once for each species in the result data.
                            In case of invalid name mergings, multiple separate GePI queries
                            are recommended that specify only one of the separate but equal-named genes, respectively.

                            Almost all information on the dashboard refers to A-List or B-List interaction partners,
                            even if one or both of the lists may actually be empty. In case of a pure full-text search
                            where List A and List B are empty, the
                            A- and B order refers to the textual order that the interaction have in a specific place
                            in the searched literature. If List A or both lists are specified, all interactions are
                            re-ordered such that the
                            interaction partner that is part of the A-List appears first before calculating the
                            statistics and visualizations. In open search scenarios - when only List A is non-empty - the
                            B-List items
                            represent the 'other' retrieved interaction partners that were not part of the query.

                        <p>
                            The Statistics dashboard element offers insight into the number of results, the most
                            frequent interaction partners and how the input query elements were recognized by the
                            Web application. The search input tables are shown for the non-empty input lists. Thus,
                            zero, one or two tables may be displayed for a given query.

                            The search input tables offer insight into the database entry an input was mapped to
                            and reports inputs that could not be recognized at all. In case of unrecognized items,
                            refer to <a href="#input-specification">Input Specification</a> for information
                            about accepted names and IDs.

                        <p>
                            The Pie Chart dashboard element offers a quick overview of the most frequent interaction
                            partners. There are two tabs that allow to switch between the display of
                            <a href="#interaction-partner-order" class="link-seconary">A or B interaction partners</a> and an input field
                            for the specification of the top N most frequent interaction partners to show. There is
                            always an additional Pie slice that carries the 'others' label. That slice accumulates
                            the frequency of all the interaction partners beyond the top N. In this way, the Pie Chart
                            slice proportions correspond to the actual proportion in the data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For open searches or large input lists, the Pie Chart may become consumed by the 'others'
                            slice. In this case, a look on the <a href="#bar-chart" class="link-secondary">Bar Chart</a>
                            is recommended. Since a Bar Chart does not necessarily display a part-whole relationship,
                            the 'others' bar may be switched off there to leave room for the top N interaction partners.

                        <p>
                            Note that that smallest Pie Slices may not receive a callout with the name of the respective
                            interaction partner due to spacial collision reasons.
                            Hover the mouse cursor over such slices to see a tooltip that will
                            provide the name.

                        <p>
                            Similar to the <a href="#pie-chart" class="link-secondary">Pie Chart</a>, the Bar Chart
                            displays the most frequent interaction partners, either from
                            <a href="#interaction-partner-order" class="link-seconary">List A or List B.</a>
                            It also allows to switch between lists and the specification of the number of interaction
                            partners to display in one chart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Bar Chart allows to display or hide the special 'others' bar through the drop-down menu next
                            to it. This bar accumulates the frequencies of all the interaction partners that are not
                            contained in the top N most frequent interactions partners that are currently shown. For
                            open searches or large closed searches, this bar may dominate the whole plot in which case
                            it is recommended to hide it.
                        </p>
                        <p>The bars show tooltips upon hovering the mouse cursor over them, showing the gene name
                        and frequency.</p>
                        <h3 id="sankey-charts">Sankey Charts</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Sankey Charts show interaction instead of interaction partner distributions. All
                            interactions with the same arguments in the same
                            <a href="interaction-partner-order" class="link-secondary">A-B order</a>
                            are accumulated to obtain the frequency of an interaction
                            in the result set. Sankey Charts leverage the frequency information to vary the thickness
                            of an edge between two gene symbol nodes as well as the size of the node. The more frequent
                            an interaction appears in the result, the thicker its edge is shown. Gene symbols that
                            participate very frequently in interactions are correspondingly larger. For each gene, the
                            Sankey Charts show the proportion of its interaction to other genes in the result set.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a Sankey Chart is enlarged using the respective button in its header,
                            additional control items will be shown to change the space between the nodes and
                            whether or not to display the 'other' nodes. These nodes represent the accumulated
                            frequencies of the interaction partners that are not explicitly shown in the chart.
                            For open searches or large closed searches, these nodes can get overly large.
                            It is recommended to deactivate the nodes in such cases but to keep in mind that
                            this truncates interactions from the Chart and skews the proportional aspect
                            of the visualization.

                            The Most frequent Interactions Sankey Chart aggregates all result interactions as described
                            above and displays the most frequent ones.

                            The Common Interaction Partners Sankey Chart also aggregates over all result interactions
                            like the Most frequent Interactions Sankey Chart but orders the interactions differently
                            to determine the top N items for display. The aim is to elevate those genes that
                            connect two other genes through interactions in high frequency. The resulting view
                            features indirect connections between two genes through such a third gene they both
                            are often described to interact with in the literature.

                            the interaction description. The table can be browsed using the paging buttons at the bottom.

                            their <a href="#factuality-filter">factuality rating</a> and the sentence from the
                            document that contains the description of the interaction. If a full-text filter was
                            set on paragraph level, a portion of the paragraph containing the filter query is also given.
