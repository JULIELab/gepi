These test resources are excerpts from official databases like NCBI gene,
homologene or NCBI Taxonomy and also from the resources built for the
gene normalization engine GeNo. Scripts to create these resources reside
within the semedico-resource-management project internal to the JULIE Lab.
A publication of these script does currently not make much sense since they
rely on access to the internal JULIE Lab server machines.
However, for the sake of the test, the existing data should suffice.
